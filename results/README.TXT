This directory contains the results for all competitors in the 2006
KDD Cup.  It contains:

Task1_results.txt	Results for Task 1
Task2_results.txt	Results for Task 2
Task3_results.txt	Results for Task 3

Each file is a tab-delimited series of columns giving a participant
ID, sub-task results, and the final score.  To preserve the
participants' privacy, the results are listed by a unique hash code.
All results are reported with respect to the hierarchical bootstrap,
as documented in the KDD Cup final report in SIGKDD Explorations.
